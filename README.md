# Docker Overview

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so that you can deliver software quickly. Docker provides the ability to package & run an application in loosely isolated environment called a container.The isolation & security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are light weight & contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.
Docker provides tooling  and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:

  1. Develop your application & its supporting components using containers.
  2. The containers becomes the unit for distributing & testing your application.
